Deep Dive into CNNs_SoC-21

Project for Seasons of Code 2021 :

The structure of this SoC was so lovely and easy to follow. Our mentors have provided some excellent resources to beginners like me in this field of Deep Neural Networks. 

Here I am listing the work done by me in various checkpoints.

Checkpoint-1 :

Work till the first checkpoint-1 was majorly oriented along with completing two introductory courses by Coursera. So I have completed those two courses and got excellent exposure to the theoretical part of Neural Networks.  These courses had programming assignments too to get familiar with Python code for Neural Networks.

Checkpoint-2 :

The work of the second checkpoint was mainly oriented towards the implementation of CNNs using Pytorch. For that, I read the resources about CNNs and how to implement them using the Pytorch-Python library. Though this library was very much new for me, it was easy to follow. 
After going through these resources, we have been told to implement the MNIST digit recognizer using Pytorch. This was excellent exposure to the Kaggle contests.

Final Submission :

Before the final submission, we were given resources about reading the research papers in Machine Learning. Here I have read the research papers of some very famous CNNs architectures. It included AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet, and GoogleNet. These papers were somewhat tricky to read, but the additional help resources helped deal with that.
After completing this theoretical part, we have to implement these four CNN architectures with some reasonably sized datasets. It was an enjoyable part to implement them. With this, my SoC journey has been concluded.

My Submissions :

I have two main folders on my Github repo for this SoC. The first one is Checkpoints. It contains the submission of the first and second checkpoints. The second one is the Final Submission. It has four notebooks that have the implementation of the four CNN architectures described above.
